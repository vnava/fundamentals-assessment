#Self Assessment (Arrays)

**We have defined an array variable `myArray` for you**

* [ ] create a new variable `lastWord` and assign it the last value of the array (access the last value of the array; DO NOT look at what the word truly is).

* [ ] log the length of the array

* [ ] log the 22nd value of the array

* [ ] access and reassign the 22nd value of the array to "sentences". DO NOT change line 1 of the code itself.

* [ ] log the 22nd value of the array again

-

* [ ] Create a proper loop that prints out each of the array's values

It should look something like :

````
This
is
an
example.

````
* [ ] `push` the value "Goodbye" to `myArray`
